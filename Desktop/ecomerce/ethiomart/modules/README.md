# Modules

This folder contains cross-cutting feature modules you can import into apps:
- `product` — product UI + domain logic
- `cart` — cart logic and storage
- `checkout` — payment workflows
- `search` — search indexing and helpers
- `user` — shared user utilities
- `seller` — seller shared components

Each module can be a separate package later if desired.
